HW: Rmarkdown
========

In this assignment, you will implement the strategies that you devised for the Euler problems from [HW1](https://github.com/UVADS/DS-2006/blob/main/assignments/hw1-euler-problems.md).

1. [Multiples of 3 or 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)
1. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
1. [Largest Prime Factor](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

Do not worry about accuracy, the goal of the assignment is to produce a reproducible report.

Create an .rmd script file called `hw2.rmd`.  In the file, describe your solutions to the problems in English (as you did in HW 1), but also write code that will implement your solution.  Knit the script file to create a report in all of the following outputs: .md, .html, .pdf, and .docx.

It may be helpful to refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

### Submission instructions

1.  In your repository, create a folder called `HW2`. 
1.  Make sure the `rmd` script and all output documents (and supporting files/folders) is in `HW2`.
1.  Sync your local and online repositories.  (Push the local repo to Github.com.)
