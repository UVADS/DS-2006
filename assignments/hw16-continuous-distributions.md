# Continuous probability models

For each of the following families of models, 
1. Identify the potential outcomes
1. Identify the model parameters
1. For arbitrary model parameters, generate a dataset of 100 draws and create three figures: (a) the histogram with the PDF overlaid, (b) the eCDF with CDF overlaid, and (c) a Q-Q plot.

FAMILIES: Normal, gamma, Weibull

1. Consider the results of an experiment where 150 fully-charged laptops.  Investigators recorded how long the laptop batteries lasted under a usual load.  Estimate-by-eye the distribution of the failure time using the eCDF and the histogram using the following Desmos calculators: (CDF)[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/os2mtzgzqg] and (histogram)[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ffp7vrz7pn].

1. With your estimated model, calculate the probability that the laptop battery will last more than 10 hours.

1. Estimate a probability model for battery cycle length using method of moments, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian updating.  From each model, calculate the probability that the laptop battery will last more than 10 hours.





### Submission instructions

1.  Within your course repo, create a folder called `HW16`
1.  Within the folder, create an .rmd script and and .md report with your solutions.
1.  The deliverable should be your own work.  You may **discuss**
    concepts with classmates, and you may **show** your code to others.
