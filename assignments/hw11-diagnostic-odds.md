Diagnostics and Screening
========

Please read sections 6.5 through 6.10 of Understanding Uncertainty.

1. Consider a cancer screening device.  Supposing that $P(\text{Cancer}) = p$, $P(+|\text{cancer}) = tp$, and $P(-|\text{not cancer}) = tn$, complete the following table with expressions of all joint, marginal, and conditional probabilities.

| | Cancer | Not Cancer | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Test = + | | | | |
|Test = - | | | | |
| | | | |


2. If $p$ = 0.01, $tp$ = 0.9, and $tn$ = 0.8, what is the positive predictive value, $P(\text{Cancer}|+)$?

3. Create a figure, with cancer incidence, $P(\text{Cancer})$, on the x-axis, going from 0 to 1 and the positive predictive value, $P(\text{Cancer}|+)$, on the y-axis.  Show how the positive predictive value changes as the incidence changes.  Generate the figure under the assumption that the sensitivity, $P(+|\text{Cancer})$, is 0.9 and the specificity, $P(-|\text{Not cancer})$, is 0.95.

### Submission instructions

1.  Within your course repo, create a folder called `HW11`
1.  Within the folder, create an .rmd script and and .md report with your solutions
1.  The deliverable should be your own work.  You may **discuss**
    concepts with classmates, and you may **show** your code to others.
