Binomial Random Variable and Bayesian Updating  
==============================================

Let X be the number of students who complete a difficult PhD program in a cohort of 29 students. Suppose $p$, the probability that an individual student will complete the degree, was unknown and needs to be estimated from data.  Suppose 22 completed in a cohort of 29.

Estimate $p$ was a Bayesian posterior.  Generate a 95% credible interval.  Use [this Desmos calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rayscxmk2t).

1. Specify a prior using $m$ and $m_2$ in lines 19 and 20.

2. Turn on the posterior by clicking the circles next to lines 22 and 23.  Click the checkmark for "Label" in line 23.

3. Notice the prior and posterior are the same because there is no data.  Update the posterior with data using the sliders $H_1$ and $T_1$ in lines 25 and 26.

4. Turn on the interval estimation by clicking the circles next to lines 29 to 32.  Click the checkmark for "Label" in lines 30 to 32.  Drag the interval endpoint up or down (or use the slider for $d$) to find the 95% credible interval.
