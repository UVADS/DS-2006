Binomial and negative binomial distribution practice problems 
=============================================================

Please complete the following problems.


1. The probability of completing a difficult PhD program is 0.7.  Calculate the probability that in a cohort of 29 students, 3 or fewer students do not complete the degree.

1. Let X be the number of students who complete a difficult PhD program in a cohort of 29 students.  Generate a plot of the probability mass function and cumulative probability function for X.  Let $p = 0.7$, as in the previous problem.

1. Suppose $p$ was unknown and needed to be estimated from data.  Suppose 22 completed in a cohort of 29.  Estimate $p$ with maximum likelihood.  Generate a 1/20 support interval.  This may help: [link](hw15a-maximum-likelihood.md)

1. Suppose $p$ was unknown and needed to be estimated from data.  Suppose 22 completed in a cohort of 29.  Estimate $p$ was a Bayesian Posterior.  Generate a 0.95 credible interval.  This may help: [link](hw15b-bayesian-posterior.md)

1. In this difficult program, students complete the degree after 5 years (no variation).  A professor decides to stop taking new students after advising 10 students to completion.  She also decides to retire after all of her active students graduate.  If the professor only takes 1 student a year (at the start of the program), what is the probability that the professor will be retired in 20 years? (As above, $p = 0.7$)

1. 3 prizes are awarded to the first 3 correct solutions of a difficult problem.  Suppose the probability of a correct solution is 0.1.  What is the probability that all three prizes will be awarded by the 25th submission?


### Submission instructions

1.  Within your course repo, create a folder called `HW15`
1.  Within the folder, create an .rmd script and and .md report with your solutions.
1.  The deliverable should be your own work.  You may **discuss**
    concepts with classmates, and you may **show** your code to others.
