Binomial Random Variable and Maximum Likelihood  
==============================================

Let X be the number of students who complete a difficult PhD program in a cohort of 29 students. Suppose $p$, the probability that an individual student will complete the degree, was unknown and needs to be estimated from data.  Suppose 22 completed in a cohort of 29.

Estimate $p$ with maximum likelihood.  Generate a 1/20 support interval.  Use [this Desmos calculator](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xxxskep7rj).

1. Use the sliders on lines 2 and 3 to input the data.  Note $n$ = number of trials and $h$ = number of successes.

2. Turn on the likelihood scaled to 1 by clicking the circle next to line 7. Click the checkmark for "Label" in line 8.

3. Turn on the support interval by clicking the circles for lines 11 to 15.  Click the checkmark for "Label" in lines 13 to 15.

4. Drag the interval endpoint up or down (or use the slider for $k$) to find the 1/20 support interval.
