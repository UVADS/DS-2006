Basic rules
========

Please read section 5.1 through 5.5 of Understanding Probability.

Consider a sporting competition between team A and B.  The teams play a series of games, only stopping when one of the teams wins 4 games.  As there are no ties, so the series will end after 4, 5, 6, or 7 games.

The table below reports the joint probabilities for the number of games played (N = 4,5,6, or 7) and the winning team (W = A or B)
 
| | A | B |
|---|---|---|
|4|0.03|0.11|
|5|0.08|0.18|
|6|0.11|0.19|
|7|0.13|0.17|

Use the basic rules of probability to answer questions 1 - 4.

1. What is the probability that the series ends in 5 or 6 games?  
1. What is the probability that team A will win supposing the series ends in 6 games?
1. What is the probability that team B wins the series or that the series will end after an even number of games?
1. What is the probability the series will end in 5 or fewer games supposing that A wins the series?
1. In section 5.4, the author provides an analytic solution to the birthday problem.  Calculate the shared birthday probability analytically for a class of size 11.  How does the value compare with the solution you generated computationally?
