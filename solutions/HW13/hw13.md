# HW 13: Confounding and randomization

1.  The following screen shot shows the contingency table when treatment
    allocation is balanced. The spreadsheet with sliders is available in
    the HW folder.

    allocation is balanced.

1.  *Δ* is the treatment effect on the absolute scale, and *ρ* is the
    treatment effect on the relative scale. *ρ* is relative because it
    is the ratio of the two quantities.

2.  *Δ* and *ρ* are shown below in the screen shots of scenario 1 and
    scenarior 2.

As the proportion of males/females changes, the treatment effect on the
absolute scale (*Δ*) stays the same.

1.  Even though the data appeared to be identical between the medical
    and agricultural examples, in the agricultural example, height was
    not a confounding variable. It is a trait that is not known at
    planting, and it does not impact the variety of seed. Rather,
    variety impacts height. As a variable on the causal pathway, it
    would be inappriopriate to adjust/stratify on this trait.

In contrast, because sex was a confounding variable in the medical
example, we would adjust/stratify.

1.  Below, note that the direction of the arrows is different. Variety
    impacts height, not the other way around.
