### 1. If the proportions in the contingency table represented probabilities, would drink preference and sugar preference be independent?

To be independent, P(Cola | Sugar) should be equal to P(Cola | Zero Sugar) and P(Cola). From the table, P(Cola | Sugar) = 0.25, P(Cola | Zero Sugar) = 0.38, and P(Cola) = 0.25. Because these three values do not match, we can determine that drink perference and sugar preference are not independent.

You can show this by comparing P(Sugar | Cola), P(Sugar | Something Else), and P(Sugar) as well. The key is to just show that the probabilitiy of one cola/sugar choice is different when conditioned on the different values for sugar/cola. 

### 2. Is a preference for Cola positively or negatively or not associated with a preference for regular sugar?

We can compare P(Cola) and P(Cola | Sugar). P(Cola) = .30 and P(Cola | Sugar) = 0.25. From here, the probabiliity of Cola decreases when conditioned on Sugar vs when not condiitoned, therefore Cola is negatively associated with regular sugar. 

If you want to look at how cola choice affects Sugar, you can compare P(Sugar) and P(Sugar | Cola). P(Sugar) = 0.60 and P(Sugar | Cola) = 0.50. Since the probability of Sugar is smaller when conditioned on Cola compared to not conditioned, we can say Sugar is negatively associated with Cola. 

Other associations: 
P(Cola) = 0.3, P(Cola | Zero Sugar) = 0.38. Positive relationship between Cola and Zero Sugar. 

### 3. Consider the population of individuals who suffer from migraine headaches. What can you conclude from this data about the effectiveness of the more toxic treatment?

| | Fewer than 3 migraines per month | 3 or more migraines per month |
| ---- | ------ | ---- |
| Less toxic treatment | 0.4 | 0.1 |
| More toxic treatment | 0.3 | 0.2 |

Because this is observational rather than experiemental data, we cannot make a conclusion on the effectiveness of the two treatments. We did not control for other confounding factors. These observational data only imply correlation and can not determine causation.
