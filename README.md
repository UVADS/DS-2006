# Computational Probability, Spring 2024

## Overview

This course is all about variation, uncertainty, and randomness.  Students will learn the vocabulary of uncertainty and the mathematical and computational tools to understand and describe it.

## Big ideas & Learning Outcomes

The following are the four ideas that I hope will persist with students after the minutia of the Poisson distribution has faded from memory.  Expand each section to see the associated learning outcomes and topics.

<details>
<summary>Probability is a framework for organizing beliefs; it is not a statement of what your beliefs should be.</summary>

## Grading

Courses carrying a Data Science subject area use the following grading system: A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F.  The symbol W is used when a student officially drops a course before its completion or if the student withdraws from an academic program of the University.

Grading Scale: 

 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+
 - 83-86 B 
 - 80-82 B- 
 - 77-79 C+ 
 - 73-76 C 
 - 70-72 C- 
 - <70 F

Grades will be a weighted average of the final exam score (30%), the midterm exams (each 15%), the deliverables (20%) and homeworks (20%).
 
Individual homeworks are graded with a score of 0, 1, or 2.  After the initial grading, students may resubmit homework within one week of feedback for an additional point.  That is, an initial score of 1 can be bumped up to a 2.  Likewise, a 0 can be bumped up to a 1.

Deliverables are larger assignments than homework.  To complete the deliverables, you will use probability models to build simulations of complex real world processes to answer questions.  Deliverables are graded like homeworks, including the opportunity to resubmit for an additional point.

Midterm exams are graded on a 100 point scale.  For midterm 1, if your grade on midterm 2 or the final is higher, the higher score will replace the score for midterm 1.  Likewise, for midterm 2, if your grade on the final exam is higher, the higher score will replace the score for midterm 2.  For example, suppose your exams scores for the midterms and final were 72, 88, 85.  For the purposes of the final grade, your exam scores would be 88, 88, 85.
 
The final exam is Thursday, May 9 at 9:00am, as assigned by the university.  Approximately one week prior to the exam, the instructor will provide a set of questions for which students will prepare solutions and written explanations. During the final exam period, the instructor will provide a supplementary set of questions related first. For example, the instructor may ask:

* Please explain how you solved a particular question in the initial set.
* Please solve a new question (perhaps closely related to a question in the initial set).  
* Please explain course topic X.  

Students will be graded on both the accuracy of their responses and the clarity with which they explain course concepts and solutions to questions.

Homeworks, deliverables, reading assignments, and exams will be posted on the course calendar below.

## Adjustments

The instructor may alter the course content and grading policies during the semester.

## Collaborative learning

Students are encouraged to study together.  The instructions for each assignment/deliverable will indicate if and how students may work together.  Students should not collaborate on midterm or final exams.  Students that violate the collaborative-work policy on an assignment, deliverable, or exam will receive a score of 0 on the assignment, deliverable, or exam.  Students may be referred to UVA Honor Committee.

**University of Virginia Honor System.** All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia.  The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.

## Accommodations

UVA is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC), to request an official accommodation. You can find more information about SDAC, including how to apply online, through their website at www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please make sure to send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
